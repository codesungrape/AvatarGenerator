# Playwright Coverage Setup Journey - Complete Summary

Great work on successfully setting up coverage reporting for your Playwright tests! Let's summarize the journey we've taken together to get your Vue/Vite application's test coverage working.
What We've Accomplished

Identified the Challenge: We started with your need to set up code coverage for Playwright tests similar to Jest coverage reports for unit tests.
Worked Through Configuration Issues:

Created an initial configuration that needed TypeScript modifications
Discovered and fixed issues with the server port (changed from 3000 to 5173)
Used TypeScript assertions to work around type definition limitations

Solved Connection Issues:

Identified that your development server was running on port 5173 instead of the expected 3000
Updated the webServer configuration to point to the correct port

Created an Explicit Coverage Test:

Built a dedicated test file at /Users/shantirai/Desktop/PROJECTS/avatarGenImg/tests/explicit-coverage.spec.ts
Used the page.coverage API to explicitly collect JavaScript coverage
Added code to save coverage data to the playwright-coverage directory

Fixed URL Assertion Issues:

Modified the test to correctly expect your application's actual URL
Successfully ran the test which generated coverage data

The Final Working Setup
You now have:

Configuration File:

/Users/shantirai/Desktop/PROJECTS/avatarGenImg/playwright.config.ts with:

Correct webServer port (5173)
TypeScript-friendly coverage configuration

Coverage Test File:

/Users/shantirai/Desktop/PROJECTS/avatarGenImg/tests/explicit-coverage.spec.ts
Successfully collects and saves coverage data

Coverage Output:

/Users/shantirai/Desktop/PROJECTS/avatarGenImg/playwright-coverage/coverage-data.json
Raw coverage data that can be transformed into readable reports

Next Steps
Now that you have coverage collection working, here's what you can do next:

Generate Human-Readable Reports:
bashCopy# Install NYC for report visualization
npm install -D nyc

# Add to package.json

# "scripts": {

# "coverage-report": "nyc report --reporter=html --reporter=text --temp-dir=./playwright-coverage"

# }

# Generate HTML report

npm run coverage-report

View Your Coverage Report:

Open /Users/shantirai/Desktop/PROJECTS/avatarGenImg/coverage/index.html in your browser
This will show you a color-coded view of which lines are covered by your tests

Integrate With Your Regular Tests:

Apply the coverage collection technique to your main test files
Or run all tests with coverage enabled

Improve Coverage:

Identify areas with low coverage in your report
Add tests for uncovered functionality

You've successfully set up Playwright coverage reporting for your Vue/Vite application! Is there any specific aspect of this setup you'd like me to explain in more detail?
